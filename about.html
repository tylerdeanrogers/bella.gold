          <p class="f4 mt4-ns pt0 tl lh-copy">Currently living in New York, Bella works as a interior textile designer at Bruce + Hansen working with clients such as Calvin Klein, Supreme, and ONE57. Recently graduating from RMIT's prestigious Bachelor of Design (Fashion) with First-class honours in 2015, Bella moved from Melbourne, Australia to place herself as the Product Specialist at Acne Studios Flagship store in Soho. </br></br>
          Previously designing for Camilla Australia, Bella has also interned in Paris for Alexander Wang, Rag and Bone and Phillip Lim.</br></br>

          Bella’s graduate collection was chosen to be part of the 2015 Melbourne Spring Fashion Week Emerging Designer showcase, the collection was also mentioned in Oyster and i-D Magazine as new designers to watch. Whilst studying a semester at Parsons New School of Design in Paris, Bella was awarded the Sophia Hallette Prize for design 2014.</br></br>

          Bella’s fashion design has always ridden alongside her illustration career. BM.illustrations started in 2014 and has seen Bella illustrating for private and commercial commissions worldwide, clients from Stockholm to Colombia. Also, working with companies such as Cotton On Australia, for live sketching events. Her fashion-esque portraits have been noticed by the likes of Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Candice Swanepoel.</br></br>

          Whilst freelancing, Bella has had the opportunity to travel extensively and work in international markets, from Europe, North America and Australasia, giving her first hand experience on the commercial and creative differences within the industry and easy adaptation to the current setting.</br></br>

          Bella’s fashion practice plays with the prescribed acceptance of fashion in the everyday and the fantasy of the curated image and it’s importance in the deliverance of design. Focusing on each aspect from the details of construction up to the photography and image retouching and finding herself someplace between the worlds of fashion and illustration.</br></br>
